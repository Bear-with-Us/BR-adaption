# BR-adaption
Adapt BR font to a given text.<br>
Our major goal is to produce a program which would be able to take in a pdf file and return a new pdf file that adapts bionic reading font to the text.<br>
Currently, we are only able to adapt the conversion on a text based pdf file and struggling with a scanned pdf file.

本项目由于图像识别技术尚未达到预期从而被延迟, 重启时间待定. <br>
Due to the unintended difficulty of a subtask(word reconition from images) this project is temporarily suspended from the organization's development schedule.

We've tried everything—OCR, direct PDF extraction, AI APIs, and even considered throwing some Machine Learning magic at it. But after all that, our grand conclusion? Yeah... it's a no-go for now. 🚀🤷‍♂️------------My-Rhythm
